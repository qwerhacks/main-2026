		Who We Are
	</h1>
	
	<p class="text-lg md:text-xl mb-8 text-center" style="font-family: 'Spectral', serif;">
		We are UCLA’s first LGBTQIA+ hackathon, founded in 2020!
	</p>

		Our Mission
	</h2>
	
	<p class="text-lg mb-4" style="font-family: 'Spectral', serif;">
		QWER Hacks aims to celebrate and increase the visibility of the LGBTQIA+ community in tech by developing products to benefit marginalized individuals and bringing together LGBTQIA+ individuals and allies in a welcoming & fun atmosphere that celebrates identity, intersectionality, and community.
	</p>
	
	<p class="text-lg mb-8" style="font-family: 'Spectral', serif;">
		QWER Hacks aims to mobilize and bring together LGBTQIA+ individuals and allies to uplift marginalized communities, while celebrating authenticity, promoting inclusivity, and enabling shared prosperity.
	</p>

	<h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl mb-4 mt-12" style="font-family: 'Ranille Normal', serif;">
		Do social impact and tech go hand in hand?
	</h2>
	
	<p class="text-lg mb-4" style="font-family: 'Spectral', serif;">
		In some cases, yes — yet we must realize that tech is just a tool. Tech is not the end but merely the means to the end.
	</p>
	
	<p class="text-lg mb-4" style="font-family: 'Spectral', serif;">
		In some instances, technology has played an essential role in bringing together members of the community as well as pushing for actionable change. While technology is far from the only way to fight for equity, it is one of the most effective means of mobilization now. We must mobilize people (that includes hackers like you!) because societal progress is by, for, and driven by the people.
	</p>
	
	<p class="text-lg mb-8" style="font-family: 'Spectral', serif;">
		We would love to have you join QWER Hacks 2026 in-person. Come build social impact projects and uplift our queer communities and beyond.
	</p>
